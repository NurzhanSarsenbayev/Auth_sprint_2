Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned what masturbation is. With his parents' blessing, Bucky hops on a bus to Los Angeles to make it big there as a porn star. He is taken under the wings of a few people in LA.

His life changes when he meets Dorothy Stratten working behind the counter of a Dairy Queen. Dorothy is a pretty but naive high school senior. Paul immediately falls for Dorothy, who sees in Paul a wise, worldly person unlike herself. Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality: not only does Dorothy eventually marry him, she becomes the August 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career. As Dorothy's star rises, Paul's life is one of a hanger-on as those in Dorothy's new circle, including Playboy publisher Hugh M. Hefner and movie director Aram Nicholas, don't much like Paul. Paul is unable to eke out a life of his own without using Dorothy's name, which she increasingly is reluctant to provide to her husband. Those that know the couple know their relationship cannot continue as is, and it's only a matter of how it will change or end is the question.", "genres": [{"uuid": "8a7a23d2-825c-4c7e-affb-0ba0dd2f907e", "name": "Biography"}, {"uuid": "0c012100-0912-49ee-91d2-9c260fbc4441", "name": "Drama"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "d89e4ef3-8df4-48fb-a66e-210b86601ccf", "full_name": "Carroll Baker"}, {"uuid": "b958f98f-d660-4b5d-8864-3c7e1b5e761a", "full_name": "Cliff Robertson"}, {"uuid": "c2288415-00ff-484a-a2f5-bbf2cfe1bc9a", "full_name": "Eric Roberts"}, {"uuid": "31c3ab59-130d-427c-b7fb-20bf4815ef58", "full_name": "Mariel Hemingway"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "8a577954-0059-45e2-8a44-d29c137e11f8", "full_name": "Bob Fosse"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "8a577954-0059-45e2-8a44-d29c137e11f8", "full_name": "Bob Fosse"}, {"uuid": "773e8496-c8d1-4d15-9b6a-314a753882f5", "full_name": "Teresa Carpenter"}]}

Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.", "genres": [{"uuid": "43a952ae-8b48-4d79-882b-3a53f2fad9a7", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "6e24e0e2-db65-4e09-9e9b-8699c54a8489", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [], "directors": [{"uuid": "73e4e1ee-f0b2-45f8-a48b-e68428275737", "full_name": "Frederick S.

The probe contains blueprints, and a message from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, who claims to have a device which can cleanse Earth of its radiation damage. The blueprints are of a supercraft that can enable any ship to head to Iscandar (situated in another galaxy) and back in a year, and with these plans the denizens of Earth secretly rebuild a Japanese battleship, the Yamato, into a great space battleship. A large intrepid crew of 999 departs for Iscandar in the Yamato to require the device... but with the menace of the Gamilas, can they succeed in time?", "genres": [{"uuid": "1f7f5de7-67cf-457b-b3eb-e4f727c0aad1", "name": "Action"}, {"uuid": "bf6d05b1-66b6-435e-8bdb-6486a0b88c9b", "name": "Adventure"}, {"uuid": "08ee6f95-29f5-494c-b4a0-475d9751a64f", "name": "Animation"}, {"uuid": "cd58503a-fe4d-4bf9-bf9e-42e83cd476f0", "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "5ff53f90-8aa1-4629-a99e-4135c7fe8a1e", "full_name": "Mallorie Rodak"}], "directors": [], "writers": []}

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, it looks at the toys' history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today.", "genres": [{"uuid": "43a952ae-8b48-4d79-882b-3a53f2fad9a7", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "d7c1a56f-f0fd-4ec3-a6c9-d8568c1c629f", "name": "History"}, {"uuid": "cd58503a-fe4d-4bf9-bf9e-42e83cd476f0", "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "d9ba8f40-e263-4121-86d3-f541034391b8", "full_name": "John Booth"}, {"uuid": "1bbde65a-bdb1-4838-8242-2577f4867b24", "full_name": "John Cook"}, {"uuid": "214b4648-657a-4dc9-8fa4-5e96948614a5", "full_name": "Tom Beaumont"}, {"uuid": "04a2f7cc-fd9b-4758-9021-150e509f1d76", "full_name": "Tom Berges"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "ee8e29f9-bca7-4f8a-84db-9b37e3a7b28a", "full_name": "Brian Stillman"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "ee8e29f9-bca7-4f8a-84db-9b37e3a7b28a", "full_name": "Brian Stillman"}]}

The Jedi Order is reestablished on the planet Yavin 4, and has continued to train new Jedi Knights in the art of peace and justice. But all is not peaceful in this new world. With the fall of the Dark Empire, the ancient Skenvi Empire now comes out of the shadow to make its move. The Skenvi now oppose the New Republic for control over the galaxy with their aggressively growing empire. The Skenvi seek to seize control of all the galaxy's most valuable resources to cripple their enemies. And if a planet refuses to join them, they have been known to take very aggressive actions. Caught in between this struggle over the fate of the galaxy is the little planet of Coreign. The planet possesses a very powerful resource that would greatly favor the side that has access to it if a galactic war was to emerge. In its eagerness to gain access to Coreign's resources, the Skenvi Empire sends its most infamous negotiator, Lord Siege. He is a man who is known throughout the galaxy for seeing that the Skenvi Empire gets what it wants by all means necessary. The New Republic sends two of its Jedi ambassadors, Master Soran Darr and his padawan, Raven Darkham.", "genres": [{"uuid": "1f7f5de7-67cf-457b-b3eb-e4f727c0aad1", "name": "Action"}, {"uuid": "bf6d05b1-66b6-435e-8bdb-6486a0b88c9b", "name": "Adventure"}, {"uuid": "cd58503a-fe4d-4bf9-bf9e-42e83cd476f0", "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "485fdeb2-d4f4-4f85-bcc6-348c250c3bc0", "full_name": "Carolina Neurath"}, {"uuid": "af09bf63-42e9-479d-944f-020575361a83", "full_name": "Karl Lindqvist"}, {"uuid": "79a4037b-4363-4395-9ea0-fab9e39bf38f", "full_name": "Patrik Hont"}, {"uuid": "cbe9c3a0-683b-4a4f-93d3-b075ecfee721", "full_name": "Stephanie Douglas Anderberg"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "ec51f2d3-a999-464e-bfe3-f5f15874d9c3", "full_name": "Rasmus Tirzitis"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "7ddf9af7-0532-4815-8da5-252adb776357", "full_name": "Jeffrey Long"}, {"uuid": "bee563bd-b775-4f7c-8151-bc082ad9c7bf", "full_name": "Matthew Davis"}, {"uuid": "c3fb1b66-20bf-4dfe-b7ae-3e2b8a34e2dc", "full_name": "Michael Banno"}, {"uuid": "ec51f2d3-a999-464e-bfe3-f5f15874d9c3", "full_name": "Rasmus Tirzitis"}, {"uuid": "a3c681a2-bc40-470d-b12b-55804d550c43", "full_name": "Steven Parker"}]}

The latest incident in the feud is an on-field brawl between the players worse than they have ever had, which results in an indefinite suspension of both teams from the league pending a full investigation. Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, Jos\u00e9, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, In\u00eas Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and In\u00eas fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and In\u00eas do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, In\u00eas' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/In\u00eas relationship being fraught with life long problems. As Paul and In\u00eas' love deepens, so does the feud, the two which truly may be incompatible.", "genres": [{"uuid": "0c012100-0912-49ee-91d2-9c260fbc4441", "name": "Drama"}, {"uuid": "ea69fc5c-a50a-414d-944b-7839942c79e8", "name": "Romance"}, {"uuid": "47520018-6790-46e4-abc3-a78450afc0df", "name": "Sport"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "12842690-22ac-48c0-b7c5-5e72735b9c7a", "full_name": "Ant\u00f3nio Fonseca"}, {"uuid": "23c35c52-0ebf-4e29-8c06-86ae24314af6", "full_name": "Kyle Redmond-Jones"}, {"uuid": "db517712-2e52-4b4b-b91e-3d7ae7d409b6", "full_name": "Neil Fluellen"}, {"uuid": "e0115a7d-3c35-4b41-ad12-4402476405df", "full_name": "Teresa Tavares"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "4886157e-78d6-4741-87a7-01cefe220a96", "full_name": "Mark Heller"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "3d14ab4d-fe11-433d-a6e3-0b90cb99e70b", "full_name": "Neil Jackson"}, {"uuid": "be63a128-b734-430d-960a-138577e74a13", "full_name": "Tiago Santos"}]}

Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \"surviving\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts.

The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job.

{"uuid": "08e512bc-b6a7-4f3f-98bf-e0423693710b", "title": "Joan Crawford: Always the Star", "imdb_rating": 2.7, "description": "This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.", "genres": [{"uuid": "43a952ae-8b48-4d79-882b-3a53f2fad9a7", "name": "Documentary"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "a8fa5892-5f0d-414f-895a-8b2cbc4e1f99", "full_name": "Ben Cooper"}, {"uuid": "b958f98f-d660-4b5d-8864-3c7e1b5e761a", "full_name": "Cliff Robertson"}, {"uuid": "20a77479-ccfc-4e72-9f71-7c3661360d1b", "full_name": "Diane Baker"}, {"uuid": "db6a6322-c7fd-4146-b013-bb993e38c522", "full_name": "Joan Crawford"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "3bece20b-e0bb-48e1-b03f-ab05c0a47c08", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}, {"uuid": "b49f7044-c62d-44df-a724-19d91d6cc1e4", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "3bece20b-e0bb-48e1-b03f-ab05c0a47c08", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}, {"uuid": "b49f7044-c62d-44df-a724-19d91d6cc1e4", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}]}

In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream.

The Russian filmmaker, Pavel Klusjantsev, has had an extraordinary influence on an entire genre of films. Throughout his career at the film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev pioneered and invented legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and weightnessless - long before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev down.

Cassian: The Spy: Much the same as the previous supplement in terms of introducing the character and his history, the qualities the character brings to the story, and casting Diego Luna. K-2SO: The Droid: A look at the robotic character: his \"anti C-3PO personality,\" character design, Alan Tudyk's motion capture performance, and the humor the actor brought to the set. Baze and Chirrut: Guardians of the Whills: The actors discuss landing and accepting the roles, the characters' camaraderie, individual character details, faith and the force in the movie and the Star Wars universe, and the actors' physical performances. Bodhi and Saw: The Pilot and The Revolutionary: The piece begins with Riz Ahmed's auditions and crafting the character, the character's fate, and making key sequences. It moves on to examine Forest Whitaker's character and his history in the Star Wars universe, character definition and history, Whitaker's preparations for the role, and more. The Empire: A run through of key Imperial characters, including Galen Erso, Orson Krennic, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Darth Vader and the qualities (and in Vader's case, the presence) their actors brought to their roles. Visions of Hope: The Look of Rogue One: Designing a world that's true and familiar to the Star Wars universe but still unique to the film. It explores set construction, small design changes, and the black stormtroopers. The Princess and The Governor: Digitally recreating two important characters. Epilogue: The Story Continues (1080p, 4:15): Images from the film's premiere juxtaposed against fans talking up the film and the franchise.

The making of this family-centric storied movie is very much as a family, as Foxx, Bailey and Schlatter have been friends for years and treat each other as family.", "genres": [{"uuid": "43a952ae-8b48-4d79-882b-3a53f2fad9a7", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "6e24e0e2-db65-4e09-9e9b-8699c54a8489", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "b9fbeedc-f7ea-4083-b7a6-417a215eab30", "full_name": "Allan Drake"}, {"uuid": "43efec96-c292-423e-8ba3-51943ca01f81", "full_name": "Dennis Dugan"}, {"uuid": "48278f3e-61ba-4d42-8dc2-2ef2b2317ed1", "full_name": "Pearl Bailey"}, {"uuid": "e3b2edd3-0adc-4142-8636-a66dcd116582", "full_name": "Tamara Dobson"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "6b51b866-4e91-428e-a758-0a387125b8cb", "full_name": "Elliot Geisinger"}], "writers": []}

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist's camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person's wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.", "genres": [{"uuid": "43a952ae-8b48-4d79-882b-3a53f2fad9a7", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "d7c1a56f-f0fd-4ec3-a6c9-d8568c1c629f", "name": "History"}, {"uuid": "b56f8004-db59-4f6f-a17e-d7ef488fae8f", "name": "News"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "033a4a5f-d458-4f78-ad27-27332138d3d0", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1ec2dc56-480c-44c7-92c8-6a7679217ff3", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "4de7c48e-f6fd-4322-a546-2109d047167f", "full_name": "Matthew Mercer"}, {"uuid": "cb8f1774-ccee-4685-87b1-cd63fdc575d5", "full_name": "Yoani Sanchez"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "033a4a5f-d458-4f78-ad27-27332138d3d0", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1ec2dc56-480c-44c7-92c8-6a7679217ff3", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "fa72c3f8-017f-40c1-920c-19785bd5f426", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "033a4a5f-d458-4f78-ad27-27332138d3d0", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1ec2dc56-480c-44c7-92c8-6a7679217ff3", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "fa72c3f8-017f-40c1-920c-19785bd5f426", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}]}

The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that \"they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap.\" Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found \"an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15.\" \"I dodged all the agencies,\" he explained, \"and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow.\" The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the \"Soap Suds Star,\" Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. \"It's all your fault,\" he said bitterly, \"You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics.\" \"I think it a dandy idea,\" said the agent. \"Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene\" The manager, impressed, retained his \"Soap Suds Star,\" and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life position in the laundry.", "genres": [{"uuid": "5a9648da-43ad-41fd-8861-ef360e63d1f8", "name": "Comedy"}, {"uuid": "6e24e0e2-db65-4e09-9e9b-8699c54a8489", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "d08e2416-978b-4fbd-83e3-9545aa4f3881", "full_name": "Carey L.
